* SARON
From `sar` the utility for system activity reports, and a pun on Sauron, and the "all seeing eye".

A flask app that will ssh to a bunch of hosts, run sar, and the graph the results for you.

Very much under development, so you'll need to do a bit more than
`setup.py install`, i.e. get jquery and jquery sparklines, and place
them in the static folder, make sure sar is installed, edit
commands.py with the hosts and specific commands you want to run, etc, etc.


The end goal here is to package this up in such a way that you can SCP
it to one host on a cluster, start it up and have monitoring across
the (small) cluster. Cluster nodes don't need direct internet access
for an install, they just need to have sar and passwordless ssh
access. As far as I know, there is no dead simple monitoring package
that is stupidly easy to install and configure.
